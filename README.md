MMA notebooks illustrating how to use xAct 

This repo (as of now!) contains MMA notebooks that I wrote while following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQqbyR8hCrA) tutorial to learn xAct. It also contains a notebook in which I solved some assignment questions from a GR course I had attended in 2023 using xAct.
